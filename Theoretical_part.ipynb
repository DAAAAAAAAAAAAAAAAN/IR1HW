    "The team-draft interleaving method makes an incorrect judgement when, for instance, there exists only one relevant (clicked) document and it is ranked differently by two different algorithms. <br>\n",
    "Let us consider the following example. Given two ranking algorithms A and B, we assume that these algorithms operate on a collection of three documents ($d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$) where only one of them (say, $d_3$, is relevant). Hence, algorithm A ranks the documents in the following order: $d_1: N$, $d_2:R$, $d_3:N$ while algorithm B ranks them as follows: $d_2: R$, $d_3:N$, $d_1:N$. Intuitively, algorithm B must win the competition as it assigns a higher rank to the only relevant document. However, this does not take place in reality if the team-draft interleaving method is applied. <br>\n",
    "As the order of picking the documents is randomized, there exist four possible assignments (\"ABA\", \"ABB\", \"BAA\", \"BAB\"), which represent the order in which each algorithm (encoded as a literal in a given sequence) picks a preferred document. The resulting rankings are as follows: <br><br>\n",

    "**BAB**: \n",
    "> {$d_2: N$} (from B), {$d_1: N$} (from A), {$d_3: R$} (from B)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that the only relevant document $d_3$ is ranked to appear third in all the assignments. As a result, the team-draft method considers this situation a tie while it is clear from the initial conditions that algorithm B should be preferred over algorithm A. In conclusion, the case described above represents a situation where the team-draft interleaving method incorrectly evaluates given ranking algorithms."
