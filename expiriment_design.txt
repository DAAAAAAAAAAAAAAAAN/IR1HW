construct 59000 pairs
M times:
	testset <- pick 1000 pairs at random
	for each pair in testset:
		testset_AP -> higher value = winner
		testset_nDCG -> higher value = winner
		testset_ERR -> higher value = winner
		testset_interleaving_RCM (N iterations) -> most wins = winner
		testset_interleaving_SDCM (N iterations) -> most wins = winner
	each measure -> most wins = winner
	10 unique pairs of measures, do they agree on winner? y/n

10 unique pairs of measures, how many times do they agree?
10 unique pairs of measures -> perform significance test



winner of
pair: the higher value for each delta measure, or the most wins for an interleaving experiment
random set of pairs: for each measure, the algorithm with the highest number of wins



expected:
- when 2 rankings are identical, the offline measures should be indiscriminate, and the interleaving experiments should sometimes be indiscriminate, but other times pick a winner randomly.
